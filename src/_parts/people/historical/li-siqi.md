Ming general Li Siqi persuaded Yuan general Wang Baobao to surrender. When leaving, why did he cut off his arm and give it to Wang Baobao?

In history, there is such a heroic and capable general-Li Siqi. He experienced countless battles in his life, but he is most famous for his successful attempt to persuade Yuan Dynasty general Wang Baobao to surrender at the end of the Ming Dynasty.

The story takes place in the autumn of 1628 AD. At that time, the Ming Dynasty was already in crisis, and the Yuan Dynasty took the opportunity to attempt to restore the country. At this critical moment, Li Siqi was appointed as the Grand Governor, responsible for resisting the invasion of the Yuan army.

During the battle, Li Siqi relied on his outstanding military talents and perseverance to defeat the powerful Yuan army many times.

However, in a crucial decisive battle, his subordinate Wang Baobao suddenly betrayed the Ming Dynasty and defected to the Yuan Dynasty. This made Li Siqi feel very sad, and at the same time, it also made him feel a heavy responsibility.

Therefore, Li Siqi decided to take action personally to persuade Wang Baobao to return to the Ming Dynasty camp. Under his hard and soft tactics, Wang Baobao finally agreed to consider it.

From then on, Wang Baobao became Li Siqi's most loyal friend and comrade-in-arms. Together they fought against foreign enemies and defended the country. Their deeds have been passed down to this day, allowing people to see the power of loyalty, bravery and friendship.

Through this incident, we can see Li Siqi's courage and wisdom, as well as his deep love for friendship and country.

His story tells us that no matter what difficulties and challenges we face, as long as we persist in justice and faith, we will be able to achieve final victory.
