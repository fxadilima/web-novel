## Li Siqi

Li Siqi adalah sekutu dari Chaghan Temur.

Li Siqi was a friend of Chaghan Temur who participated in the early military campaigns of the latter against the Red Turbans. By the end of the 1350s Li had become the dominant local power in Shaanxi.[36] After Chaghan Temur's death, Li refused to acknowledge Köke Temür as Chaghan Temur's successor and went to war with him.[39] Li surrendered to the Ming dynasty on 21 May 1369.
